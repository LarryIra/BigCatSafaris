    <h2 class="text-center mb-5">Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <div class="terms-content p-4 bg-white shadow rounded">

      <p>These booking conditions form the basis of your contract with ("we", "us", and "our"). Please review them carefully as they outline our respective rights and obligations. By requesting us to confirm your booking, you are deemed to have read and agreed to these conditions.</p>

      <p>These booking conditions apply solely to the trip arrangements you book with us in Rwanda, which we agree to make, provide, or perform (as applicable) under our contract with you. References to "trip", "booking", "contract", or "arrangements" pertain to these trip arrangements unless stated otherwise. References to "departure" denote the start date of these arrangements.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Booking Your Trip and Payment Details</h4>
      <p><strong>Booking Procedure:</strong> To make a booking, please follow the procedure outlined on our website or request an offline application form. Each traveller must complete the relevant form. If you are under 18 at the time of booking, the form must be signed by your parent or guardian or initiated online during the booking process. Submit the completed booking form along with the payments specified below.</p>

      <p>If we have confirmed the availability of your chosen arrangements and you book within the applicable time frame, your booking is considered firm, and a contract between us will be established upon receipt of your completed application form and deposit. We will send a receipt for all payments and an invoice. If availability has not been confirmed, the contract will be established upon dispatch of our invoice. For bookings made through our website without prior confirmation, any electronic acknowledgment is not a confirmation of the booking. Verify your invoice upon receipt and contact us immediately if any information is incorrect or incomplete.</p>

      <p><strong>Payment Details:</strong> A minimum deposit of $100.00 or full payment when the tour cost is less than $300. We also offer an instalment plan where 50% of the trip payment is due at least 3 months before departure. The full balance must be received by us no later than six weeks prior to departure. Bookings made within six weeks of departure require immediate full payment.</p>

      <p>If the balance (including any applicable surcharge) is not received by the due date, we reserve the right to treat the booking as cancelled by you. If we do not cancel immediately due to a payment promise, you must pay the cancellation charges as outlined in paragraph 7 based on when we reasonably treat your booking as cancelled.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Price and Changes</h4>
      <p>The quoted price covers the cost of planning, organizing, and executing the trip, including group equipment, supplies, accommodation, administration, and staff. You are responsible for additional costs such as vaccination fees, travel insurance, travel to/from the start/return point, international flights, passport and visa costs, personal equipment, and personal expenses not specifically included in the trip description or invoice.</p>

      <p>We reserve the right to amend and correct errors in quoted prices before your trip is confirmed. We will notify you of any such errors and the applicable price at the time of booking.</p>

      <p>After confirmation, the price may be adjusted due to changes in transportation costs, dues, taxes, fees, or exchange rates used in calculating your trip cost. Any surcharge or refund will be based on these changes. If a surcharge exceeds 10% of the trip cost, you may cancel your booking and receive a full refund of all monies paid or purchase an alternative trip as described in paragraph 12.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Travel Insurance</h4>
      <p>It is essential to have adequate travel insurance for your trip, including coverage for adventurous activities such as trekking at altitude. Ensure your policy covers cancellation costs from the booking date and medical expenses, including evacuation and repatriation.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Health</h4>
      <p>By booking, you confirm you are in good health, physically capable of undertaking all aspects of the trip, and unaware of any condition that may affect your suitability to participate or risk of illness or injury. If you have any medical condition or disability that may impact your trip, contact us before submitting your application form for assistance in assessing the trip's suitability for you.</p>

      <p>If information on your application form or medical questionnaire is found to be materially incorrect or incomplete, we reserve the right to cancel your booking or terminate your participation, with cancellation charges as specified in paragraph 7.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Special Requests</h4>
      <p>Notify us of any special requests prior to booking. While we will strive to accommodate such requests, confirmation of a special request does not guarantee fulfillment. Obtain written confirmation where important to you.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Cancellations and Changes</h4>
      <p><strong>Cancellation Charges:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>12 weeks or more before departure: $100.00 per person.</li>
        <li>12 to 6 weeks before departure: 25% of the total cost.</li>
        <li>6 to 2 weeks before departure: 50% of the total cost.</li>
        <li>2 weeks or less before departure: 100% of the total cost.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Insurance Claims:</strong> Depending on the reason for cancellation, you may be able to reclaim charges under your insurance policy. Claims should be made directly to the insurer. For partial cancellations affecting the trip's price basis, we will recalculate and re-invoice accordingly.</p>

      <p><strong>Transfer of Booking:</strong> You may transfer your place to another person (introduced by you) if you are unable to travel, provided we are notified at least 2 weeks before departure. All associated costs and any overdue balance must be settled before the transfer.</p>

      <p><strong>Changes to Confirmed Trips:</strong> Changes can be considered based on practicality and availability, but may incur additional costs. We do not charge an amendment fee but will pass on extra costs from suppliers. Changes may result in recalculating the holiday price. A change of dates will be treated as a cancellation and rebooking, subject to cancellation charges.</p>

      <p><strong>Itinerary Changes:</strong> The itinerary is a guide and may be altered due to circumstances beyond our control, such as adverse weather or force majeure. We will attempt to maintain the content of the itinerary as reasonably possible. Additional costs due to weather conditions will be mutually agreed upon.</p>

      <p><strong>Changes and Cancellations by Us:</strong> We reserve the right to make changes to and correct errors in advertised details and cancel bookings if necessary. We may cancel a trip if the minimum number of participants is not reached, with at least 28 days' notice.</p>

      <p>If we make a significant change or cancel, you may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accept the changed arrangements.</li>
        <li>Purchase an alternative trip of similar standard from us, with any price difference refunded or additional cost payable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Compensation may be provided in certain circumstances, except for force majeure or minimum participant requirements.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Force Majeure</h4>
      <p>"Force majeure" includes events beyond our control such as war, terrorism, natural disasters, significant health risks, adverse weather, and similar events. We accept no liability or compensation for obligations affected by such events.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Our Liability</h4>
      <p>We ensure that trip arrangements are made with reasonable skill and care. We accept responsibility for any failure in service or personal injury caused by our negligence. We are not liable for issues resulting from your actions, third-party actions, or force majeure. Our liability for loss or damage is limited as specified, and we cannot accept liability for any loss not foreseeable or caused by factors beyond our control.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Delays</h4>
      <p>We cannot assist with delays at departure points. If flying with Rwandair or other airline carriers, you may be entitled to compensation from the airline. Costs associated with delays are your responsibility.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Travel Information</h4>
      <p>Consult the Rwanda Tours and Travel Association website <a href="https://www.rtta.rw" target="_blank">www.rtta.rw</a> and <a href="https://www.visitrwanda.com" target="_blank">www.visitrwanda.com</a> for updated travel information before booking.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Supplier Conditions</h4>
      <p>Suppliers provide services according to their own terms, which may limit or exclude their liability.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Behavior and Damage</h4>
      <p>During your trip, follow instructions from our staff. We may terminate your trip without notice for behavior prejudicing the trip's success or safety. You are responsible for any damage or loss caused and must pay for repairs or replacements.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Passport and Visa Requirements</h4>
      <p>Check passport and visa requirements on our website and with relevant authorities. Ensure you have all necessary documents before departure. Costs for documentation are your responsibility.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Health Requirements</h4>
      <p>Be aware of compulsory health requirements and recommended vaccinations. Check for updates before departure.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Complaints</h4>
      <p>If you encounter problems, inform your trip guide or local agent immediately and follow up in writing. For unresolved complaints, contact us within 14 days of your trip’s end. For claims not involving death or injury, failure to notify may affect liability.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Contract Law and Financial Security</h4>
      <p><strong>Governing Law:</strong> Your contract is governed by Rwandan law. Claims must be dealt with by the courts of Rwanda.</p>
